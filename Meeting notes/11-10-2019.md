<h2>Attendees:</h2>
Miltion Wong, Jason Chiang, Randy Tai

<h2>Finished items (from the last meeting notes):</h2>
Read the book Chapter 1 to 5 and tried practical operation the example (.ipynb) in Google Colab from the book.

<h2>Discussion:</h2>
Miltion discussed and told the detial about example. Also, he told us how to use the dataset on website www.kaggle.com and how to change the variables to make example processed quickly. Therefore, he discussed why we need to use Google Colab's GPU to execute our project. The reason is our local GPU too low (Operating speed is very slow)
Finally, he showed the schedule of last final year project group and reminded us some important work submission time (such as interim Report).

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
a. Upload speed is quite slow. (upload files to Google Drive)
b. Google Colab is a new things for us. (do not use those function that about project in past)
c. Processing time is quite long. (training data speed is too low)

<h2>Schedule:</h2>
Self-study how to use the Kaggle dataset in Google Colab.
