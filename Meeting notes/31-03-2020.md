<h2>Discussion:</h2>
<p>Discussed the process that should finish.</p>
<p>Discussed how to implement the CycleGAN model.</p>
<p>Discussed the performance in our model.</p>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<p>The CycleGAN model is hard to understand.</p>

<h2>Schedule:</h2>
<p><strong>4-09-2019 - 25-10-2019:</strong> Read the book and know well as basic operation in Google Colab and python numpy, keras etc. function that about project.</p>
<p><strong>25-10-2019 - 08-11-2019:</strong> Executed example and find the useful code to build the project.</p>
<p><strong>08-11-2019 - 22-11-2019:</strong> Preprocessed the CNRPark+EXT dataset to reduce the excution time and improve effectiveness of the program. Also, found more dataset to support accuracy of the project</p>
<p><strong>22-11-2019 - 06-12-2019:</strong> Prepared the most challenges in project -- <b>illuminance variance detection</b>. Also, start to prepare the mid-report in reading paper.</p>
<p><strong>06-12-2019 - 31-03-2020:</strong> Improved the performance in binary classification, study the CycleGAN to generate more image for upgrading the generalization ability in our model, find more image enhancement method to increase the performance and prepared the final report in FYP.</p>
