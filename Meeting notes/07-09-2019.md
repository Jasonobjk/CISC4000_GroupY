<h2>Attendees:</h2>
Miltion Wong, Jason Chiang, Randy Tai

<h2>Finished items (from the last meeting notes):</h2>
Read the report that Prof. C.M. VONG gave and learnt (self-studied) more about the python language.

<h2>Discussion:</h2>
Miltion and we discussed what is the python library -- Numpy and simply introduce what is Outdoor Smart Parking Lots Detection System. Also, Miltion showed us the report of last year final year project and gave us some useful suggestion that made us know what should we focus on and finish in that final year project.
Finally, Miltion informed us to read a book that call 'Deep Learning with Python, by Franois Chollet' in Chapter 1 to 5 (or to 6 that if the time is enough) and self-study the python library 'Numpy'. And he will discuss them with us in next meeting.

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
a. The time maybe not enough
b. Practical examples maybe not enough.

<h2>Schedule:</h2>
Self-study the python library 'Numpy', read the book and last year report in two weeks periods.
