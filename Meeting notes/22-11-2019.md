<p>The CNRPark+EXT dataset does not give original image.</p>

<h2>Schedule:</h2>
<p><strong>4-09-2019 - 25-10-2019:</strong> Read the book and know well as basic operation in Google Colab and python numpy, keras etc. function that about project.</p>
<p><strong>25-10-2019 - 08-11-2019:</strong> Executed example and find the useful code to build the project.</p>
<p><strong>08-11-2019 - 22-11-2019:</strong> Preprocessed the CNRPark+EXT dataset to reduce the excution time and improve effectiveness of the program. Also, found more dataset to support accuracy of the project</p>
<p><strong>22-11-2019 - 06-12-2019:</strong> Prepared the most challenges in project -- <b>illuminance variance detection</b>. Also, start to prepare the mid-report in reading paper.</p>
