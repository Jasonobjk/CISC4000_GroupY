<h1>Time: 06-12-2019 17:30 to 18:00</h1>
<h2>Attendees:</h2>
<p>Miltion Wong, Jason Chiang, Randy Tai</p>

<h2>Finished items (from the last meeting notes):</h2>
<p>Tried to write the program for final year project with the basic <strong>convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model</strong> in  <strong>Deep Learning</strong>.</p>

<h2>Discussion:</h2>
<ul> 
  <li>Discussion the code and dataset of the project.</li>
  <li>Introduction Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).</li>
    <ul>
      <li>The application of GANs</li>
      <li>One example (paper) about GANs</li>
      <li>How to detect one winter image when we only train the summer dataset -- in other words, 'move' the features in original image to new image, then using those features to classify the new image.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<p>How to process the features (How to 'move' the features and how to determine the features.)</p>

<h2>Schedule:</h2>
<p>04-09-2019 - 25-10-2019: Read the book and know well as basic operation in Google Colab and python numpy, keras etc. function that about project.</p>
<p>25-10-2019 - 08-11-2019: Executed example and find the useful code to build the project.</p>
<p>06-12-2019 - 10-01-2020: Study the GANs and explored for tackling outdoor smart parking lots detection system under illuminance variance.</p>
