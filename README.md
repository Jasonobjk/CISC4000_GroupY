# Robust Outdoor Smart Parking Lots Detection System Under Illuminance Variance
# 在光照變化下強大的室外智能停車場檢測系統

Python implementation in binary classification of parking lot occupancy detection under the illuminance variance via smart camera. It based on Convolutional Neural Network model. The aims and expected deliverables is:
 * Development of CNN model specifically for parking lots.
 * Development of an integrated smart parking lots detection system.
 * Development of techniques in generative modeling for dealing with illuminance variance.
 * An integrated smart parking lots detection system applicable to outdoor parking lots
